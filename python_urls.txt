class Employee:
def __init__(self, fname, lname, eid, dept, title):
    self.__firstName = fname
    self.__lastName = lname
    self.__employeeID = int(eid)
    self.__department = int(dept)
    self.__title = title
I was able to figure this out. I opened the file and then read a line from it, stripping the \n and splitting my data. I used a while loop to keep reading lines, as long as it wasn't an empty line, and appended it to my empty list. I also had to split the first indexed item as it was first and last name together in the same string and I needed them separate.

def readFile(employees):
    with open("employees.csv", "r") as f:
        line = f.readline().strip().split(",")
        while line != [' ']:
            line = line[0].split(" ") + line[1:]
            employees.append(Employee(line[0], line[1], line[2], line[3], line[4]))
            line = f.readline().strip().split(",")
